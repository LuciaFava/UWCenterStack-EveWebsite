                        The EVE team is working with the UW EcoCAR 2 team. The EcoCAR 2 competition is a 3 year collegiate engineering competition. The competition challenges 15 universities across North America to reduce the environmental impact of a Chevrolet Malibu without compromising performance, safety and consumer acceptability. The competition is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and General Motors (GM). The competition follows the real-world Vehicle Development Process (VDP). <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Year 1</h3>
                        The first year of the competition was focused on design and simulation. Many vehicle architectures were explored before the UW EcoCAR 2 team decided to go with a Parallel Through-The-Road hybrid. On the front axel is a 1.7 L Diesel engine, and on the rear axel is a powerful electric motor powered by a 19.6 kWh battery pack. This design enables the vehicle to drive 30-40 miles without using any fuel, and then after the battery is nearly depleted, the diesel engine and electric motor can work together to optimize efficiency. At the Year 1 Competition, the UW EcoCAR 2 placed 5th out of the 15 teams for their designs and simulations. <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Year 2</h3>
                        In year two of the competition, the Malibu was delivered to the UW EcoCAR 2 lab and the overhaul began. The stock engine was removed and the new engine, motor, and battery were integrated into the car. At the Year 2 Competition, the modified car was tested in areas of performance, energy consumption, and emissions. The UW EcoCAR 2 team placed 4th overall. <br>
					    <br>
                        <h3>Year 3</h3>
                        Currently the UW EcoCAR 2 team is preparing for the Year 3 Competition where the car will be retested. The focus of this year has been refinement. Many of the software bugs and mechanical issues have been resolved. By the time of the competition, the car should feel like it just came off the assembly line. <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>More Information</h3>

                        Freescale Semiconductor has donated an i.MX6 Sabre Automotive Infotainment processor board to each team. Freescale is also is offering a $1,000 cash prize to the team that can use their hardware to create an innovative touch screen interface in the team's car. <br>
                        <br>
                        At the Year 2 Competition, the UW EcoCAR 2 team attempted to use the QNXCAR 2 platform on the i.MX6 hardware to run HTML5 apps that could communicate with other controllers in the vehicle over the vehicle CAN buses. However, there were many issues with the QNXCAR 2 software that were not able to be overcome. Despite these challenges, the UW EcoCAR 2 team was able to demonstrate their unique touch screen interface using several BlackBerry Playbooks. The interface features a clear plastic overlay on the screen with cut outs in it (much like a stencil) to help guide a user's finger without the user having to look at the screen. This concept impressed the judges and the UW EcoCAR 2 team earned 2nd place in the Freescale Innovation Award and earned a $500 prize. <br>
                        <br>
                        This year the EVE team aims to assist the UW EcoCAR 2 team in achieving 1st place!

                       EVE emphasizes driver safety by providing a well designed interface that reduces confusion and increases time spent seeing the road. The bezel in the right fits over the screen, displaying a stylish, but useful design. Users interact with the interface by tapping and gliding their fingers across the curvy sliders. The ridged shape of these sliders provide a unique feel that encourage memory of interactions with EVE through touch rather than sight. <br>					   
                       <br>
                       Furthermore, gentle but clear vibrations upon interaction provide worthwhile cues to the user. For example, as users scroll through their music in EVE, vibrations occur as each song passed in the music list. This is accomplished by use of vibration transducers. So, tactile feedback is key in minimizing distractions for the driver. Therefore, EVE offers easy steps and measures to enjoy its Apps without sacrificing safety.

                        Freescale Semiconductor has donated an i.MX6 Sabre Automotive Infotainment board. The i.MX6 is an embedded platform with a quad-core 1 GHz processor and all of the peripheral capabilities imaginable for an automotive purpose. It includes 2 CAN bus connections, HDMI, USB, audio in/out, ethernet, bluetooth capabilities and more. The low power consumption, low cost, and small form factor of the i.MX6 make it an ideal platform for running EVE in an automotive environment. <br>
                        <br>
                        The EVE interface has been developed as a node-webkit app. The UI is written in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and thanks to the power of node-webkit, is rendered in a fullscreen webkit browser while simultaneously running node.js to access additional hardware and networking capabilities that take advantage of the i.MX6. Combine EVE, node-webkit, Ubuntu, and the i.MX6 and you have the next generation touchscreen interface.

The main benefit of CAN is that it has greatly decreases the amount of wiring between the numerous electrical components in the vehicle. When it comes to the Chevy Malibu our team is working on, GMLAN is a local area network that uses the CAN protocol to provide two different communication links: low speed and high speed. The low speed bus, utilized mainly for operator control functions, uses a single wire (SWCAN) and operates at a baud rate of 33.333 kbps. Whereas, the high speed bus, which contain meaningful and real-time data, uses two wires and operates at a baud rate of 500kbps. <br>

                        When it comes to EVE, CAN is used for many its features. For example with climate control, the user's interaction on the touch screen indicating to turn on the fan triggers a CAN message to be sent through the low-speed bus to accomplish the task. Also, the high-speed bus constantly reads messages containing information that is analyzed and provided to the driver to help them develop safe and efficient driving habits.

                        <b>In the past week:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        We met with Chen on Tuesday to get his advice on vibration, and will be meeting with Sidhant today to learn about the pre-touch sensing. Form Chen, we discovered that way he was able to simulate different textures would not work with our project due to the necessry requirements such as a glass overlay over the screen.<br>
                        <br>
                        Vinod and Mitchell began work on the climate control application. As the other two applications will also use much of the same overall design, we decided to take some more time to really get the functionality of the sliders working well. As of now, we have the slider to change the temperature of fans near working. Both of us also worked on the PRD.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate built a few different Yocto-based Linux distros with some settings pre-baked into the distro such as enabling the CAN and HDMI controllers automatically (previously a manual change), but that was as far as they got as pre-bundling things in the image. They attempted and failed to build nw for the Freescale i.MX6 and decided to ditch that hardware platform. They began to mock-up a general-purpose microcontroller board/circuit to handle our vibration and pre-touch control. Nate also helped with PRD.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>For next week:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        Mitchell and Vinod will get the overall framework of the applications figured out and complete. We will also interface the UI with CANbus, and test to see if climate control perform well.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate will plan to have an understanding of how to process sound inputs to measure the Doppler effect in an effort to choose a microcontroller architecture (processing power-wise) to move forward with.<br>

                        <br>
                        Vinod and Mitchell completed the Project Proposal. We also finalized the architecture for CAN messages. As of now, as we constantly read messages through the UW high speed network, we are also able to write messages through GMLAN low speed for climate control. Mitchell worked with the Arduino board and was able to confirm being able to use it with <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">johnny-five</a>, a Javascript Arduino Programming framework.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate were able to get Linux installed on the FreeScale i.MX6. However, as of now it cannot detect the USB and HDMI, and we believe this may be due to the difficulties of getting it to shutdown properly without pulling the plug.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>For next week:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        We are meeting with Chen on Monday to discuss adding vibration. We also hope to speak with the contact Professor Patel mentioned for pre-touch gesture sensing. The goal is to choose to implement one of these for our entertainment system.<br>
                        <br>
                        Mitch and Vinod will attempt to finish the climate control application. We were told to choose one application for the scope of this project, and we are still unsure which one we would choose. We hope to get most of the climate control application done by next week so that even if we do not choose that as our application for this class, it gives us a good exercise for working with MarrionetteJS.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate will research <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/about">Yocto</a> and see if it is stable enough to fix the current issues. They will also see if the ARM processor will perform well with our applications.<br>
                        <br>
                        So, the next week is basically half of us working on the apps while in parallel, half of us work with the freescale hardware. If we find that the app performs poorly with the i.MX6's ARM processor, we may have to discuss changing our project features so that we use the other minicomputer we have already done some development on, but implement both vibration and gesture sensing.

                        <br>
                        1. Vinod and Mitchell completed the website. We coded our own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Project Details section contains an overview of our project named EVE. Once we have information for parts of the class like Kickstarter, we will add a section for it to the site. <br>
                        2. Ryan and Nate have been researching how to install Linux on the i.MX6 freescale processor. We were not able to find clear instructions on how to do this, but we did learn about the <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/about">Yocto</a> which helps create Linux-based systems for any hardware architecture. <br>
                        3. We all attended lab, and discussed our project with the TA. We discussed the hardware components and how we may be able to talk to someone who has experiance with vibration technology. <br>
                        4. We planned out what each of us will discuss during our presentation tomorrow. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Once we get feedback from our presentation, our goals for the next week are:</b> <br>
                        <br>
                        1. For Mitch and Vinod, set up a <a href="http://marionettejs.com/">Marionette</a> based home app. Marionette is an application library for JavaScript used to assist in the creation of large-scale applications. This means looking at other projects in EcoCar that have used Marionette and expand on them to make sure we have our own architecture for EVE. <br>
                        2. For Ryan and Nate, install Linux on the i.MX6, and research how to create CAN drivers for it. <br>
