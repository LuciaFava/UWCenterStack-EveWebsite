                        The EVE team is working with the UW EcoCAR 2 team. The EcoCAR 2 competition is a 3 year collegiate engineering competition. The competition challenges 15 universities across North America to reduce the environmental impact of a Chevrolet Malibu without compromising performance, safety and consumer acceptability. The competition is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and General Motors (GM). The competition follows the real-world Vehicle Development Process (VDP). <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Year 1</h3>
                        The first year of the competition was focused on design and simulation. Many vehicle architectures were explored before the UW EcoCAR 2 team decided to go with a Parallel Through-The-Road hybrid. On the front axel is a 1.7 L Diesel engine, and on the rear axel is a powerful electric motor powered by a 19.6 kWh battery pack. This design enables the vehicle to drive 30-40 miles without using any fuel, and then after the battery is nearly depleted, the diesel engine and electric motor can work together to optimize efficiency. At the Year 1 Competition, the UW EcoCAR 2 placed 5th out of the 15 teams for their designs and simulations. <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Year 2</h3>
                        In year two of the competition, the Malibu was delivered to the UW EcoCAR 2 lab and the overhaul began. The stock engine was removed and the new engine, motor, and battery were integrated into the car. At the Year 2 Competition, the modified car was tested in areas of performance, energy consumption, and emissions. The UW EcoCAR 2 team placed 4th overall. <br>
					    <br>
                        <h3>Year 3</h3>
                        Currently the UW EcoCAR 2 team is preparing for the Year 3 Competition where the car will be retested. The focus of this year has been refinement. Many of the software bugs and mechanical issues have been resolved. By the time of the competition, the car should feel like it just came off the assembly line. <br>
                        <br>

                       EVE emphasizes driver safety by providing a well designed interface that reduces confusion and increases time spent seeing the road. The bezel in the right fits over the screen, displaying a stylish, but useful design. Users interact with the interface by tapping and gliding their fingers across the curvy sliders. The ridged shape of these sliders provide a unique feel that encourage memory of interactions with EVE through touch rather than sight. <br>					   
                       <br>
                       Furthermore, gentle but clear vibrations upon interaction provide worthwhile cues to the user. For example, as users scroll through their music in EVE, vibrations occur as each song passed in the music list. This is accomplished by use of vibration transducers. So, tactile feedback is key in minimizing distractions for the driver. Therefore, EVE offers easy steps and measures to enjoy its Apps without sacrificing safety.

                        A<a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/product"> Leap Motion </a>is used to add an additional layer of safety for common interactions the driver may have with EVE. For example, skipping to the next song is something that is done very often. To further, minimize the necessity of visually looking., One can simply place their hand in front of the screen and swipe right to push the music forward one track. The infared sensing of the Leap Motion allows EVE to do this.<br>
                        <br>
                        The EVE interface has been developed as a node-webkit app. The UI is written in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and thanks to the power of node-webkit, is rendered in a fullscreen webkit browser while simultaneously running node.js to provide a nice UI that Leap can be incorportated to. Combine EVE, node-webkit, Ubuntu, and the Leap Mptopm and you have the next generation touchscreen interface.

                        CAN
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        CAN stands for Control Area Network. It is a bus protocol that is used for data communication through messages between the different parts of the car. The main benefit of CAN is that it has greatly decreases the amount of wiring between the numerous electrical components in the vehicle. When it comes to the Chevy Malibu our team is working on, GMLAN is a local area network that uses the CAN protocol to provide two different communication links: low speed and high speed. The low speed bus, utilized mainly for operator control functions, uses a single wire (SWCAN) and operates at a baud rate of 33.333 kbps. Whereas, the high speed bus, which contain meaningful and real-time data, uses two wires and operates at a baud rate of 500kbps. <br>
						<br>
                        When it comes to EVE, CAN is used for many its features. For example with climate control, the user's interaction on the touch screen indicating to turn on the fan triggers a CAN message to be sent through the low-speed bus to accomplish the task. Also, the high-speed bus constantly reads messages containing information that is analyzed and provided to the driver to help them develop safe and efficient driving habits.

                        <b>In the past week:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        Mitchell and Vinod have started work on the Leap Motion and the EVE interface.
                        We have decided the fit the leap motion above in the sun glasses holder. Using the 3D printer, we printed out some support hinges that helps keep it in place.
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Here is also a picture of the hardware mount that has been 3D printed as well. We chose this color to stick with our color theme for our website.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Coding for leap is also underway. We have decided that currently we will support four gestures with leap. When someon's hand is at the right distance away, a leap menu will show up on the screen, with gesture to one direction skipping a song, while gestures in another direct play and pause, and so forth. Here is a video of this application.<br>

                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate soldered a copy of the microcontroller board and spent lots of time troubleshooting it. They have been working on building more abstracted embedded code.<br>
                        <br>
                        Because the PWM from the Arduino could only go as low as 30ish hz, they switched over to using timer interrupts to manually toggle on/off digital outputs of the Arduino.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In addition to apps, Vinod worked on the second draft of the Kickstarter page to provide more content. The video is still the same, because we plan to film our final video this weekend when everything is put together in the car.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Our plan</b><br>
                        <br>
                        To be clear of our plan, the car leaves next Tuesday morning. Therefore, we plan to get the applications to enough of a level, and the vibration with screen (which arrived!) so that we can film our kickstarter video on Sunday while everyone is still here.<br>
                        <br>
                        Then once the car is gone, we will continue to work on applications and tweaks to the vibration code.<br>
                        <br>
                        The, Mitch, Nate, and Ryan will leave for the competition. While they continue to work on the car over there. I will work on apps from here. So, we will get permission to film a video for our final presentation/demo, although it may not be live. Then, I will present it in class on our demo date of June 9th or so.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>With this in mind, for next week:</b> <br>
                        <br>
                        For Mitch and Vinod, finish apps as much as possible so they are at a nice state for the kickstarter video. <br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate are working on a way to use a single timer interrupt to drive three different buzzers at different frequency, developed a concept, now just implementing it in software.  They need to create a node module that will interface with the Arduino via serial.  They finally got all of the parts required for the feed back system, now in the processes of soldering the driver board (which will have 5 transistors to drive the power to the buzzers). <br>

                        Vinod and Mitchell finished most of the Music USB application, and internet radio is still under progress. The general design for the driver feedback has been confirmed, and ready to implement. Coding for leap motion gestures are also underway. <br>
                        <br>
                        We have also added some more visual cues to our app for the new user and passenger's sake. This includes a loading animation and a slider indication animation:<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For Ryan and Nate, after using a signal generator to drive a linear resonant actuator via the prototype H-bridge, they decided that it was not powerful/fast enough for our use case. Instead, they are going to use a single transistor to switch on/off the current to a linear resonate actuator.  While the current flows in only one direction, unlike the H-bridge, not having to use a resister to limit the current flow during the PWM transients allows for higher current flow, offsetting the lose of the dual current direction of the H-bridge.  Not only is this a simpler design, using a single transistor per actuator, it also has a higher output, several times more powerful the what the h-bridge could produce.<br>
                        They successfully installed a bootloader onto a handful of Atmel ATmega328 processors which took some jerry-rigging due to slight differences between ours and those used in Arduinos.<br>

                        For Mitch and Vinod, finish music app and get as much done on driver feedback app, EVE, and leap motion as possible. <br>
                        For Ryan and Nate, they are now experimenting with reducing the number of pulses from the ATmega's internal timers to get lower-frequency PWM signals for vibration feedback. They may also generate the vibrations manually. <br>
                        <br>
                        Also, we heard back about the original screen we wanted to use, and it seems like we will get that by the end of this week, but we are not taking any chances, and are keeping a backup screen.<br>
                        <br>
                        Finally, the car will be leaving at the earliest on Friday of next week. So by then, we need to integrate our two components of applications and vibration working together.

                    <h3>May 13th, 2014 (Tuesday): Kickstarter Video First Draft</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here is the first draft for the video of our Kickstarter page:<br>
                        <br>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our idea for the video was to basically make it similar to a commercial since the application is primarily entertainment in the car. We found inspiration for the way we shot the video from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGfvSZqbPhw">ipod nano commerical</a>. In our video, we showed clips of some application functions, the vibration feedback, and leap motion gestures. Our car was out of the lab today, so we were not able to actually use it in our first draft, but we definitely plan to for our final draft. We will also add screens for our third app (driver feedback) in the final version of the video as well.

                        <b>In the past week:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        Vinod and Mitchell finalized climate control app. We tested our interface in the car, and were successfuly able to change the vent fan speed using our interface. Some of the other signals such as temperature are not being responsive. However, we confimed through our CAN logging tools that the messages are correctly being sent. After checking with our GM mentor, we have learned that this is a widespread issue among all the teams in EcoCar, and there is no solution for why the CHEVY Malibus do not respond to these signals which were given to us by GM. Because our logic is correct and given our limited amount of time, we decided to move on to the music app. <br>
                        This week we have completed the interface for the USB portion of the application. For internet radio, we planned to use Last.fm, but they cancelled their radio service. Therefore, right now we are exploring <a href="http://developer.feed.fm/documentation">Feed.fm</a> and <a href="http://www.iheart.com/">iHeartRadio</a>.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate built an arduino prototype and are able to get power back out of the board, but are unable to get it to respond.<br>
                        They also prototyped and h-bridge amplifier and proved the concept on a linear resonant actuator.<br>

                        <br>
                        For Ryan and Nate, in regards to the arduino, they need to update the bootloader.<br>
                        In regards to the h-bridge ampliefer, they need to get it to work with either more power or more resonance.<br>
                        They also need to get the PCB plans finalized and design a basic case for the vibration system.<br>
                        <br>
                        Mitch is also going to speak with our GM mentor to see if the competition will allow us take the car out and videochat for our final demo.  <br>
                        We need to start integrating our two componenets, and test the vibration with our applications.

                        We also worked with the leap motion device given to us by Sidhant. We had concerns about sunlight affecting the device, but when we tested it outside during a sunny day, it functioned fine. Therefore, we have decided to move forward with using the leap motion to implement our gesture recognition instead of the sound wave technology. For the leap motion, we implemented some basic interaction with the computer screen. As the hand enters the leap motion space, the screen brightens, and when it is removed, the screen dims:<br>

                        We met with Chen on Tuesday to get his advice on vibration, and will be meeting with Sidhant today to learn about the pre-touch sensing. Form Chen, we discovered that way he was able to simulate different textures would not work with our project due to the necessry requirements such as a glass overlay over the screen.<br>
                        <br>
                        Vinod and Mitchell began work on the climate control application. As the other two applications will also use much of the same overall design, we decided to take some more time to really get the functionality of the sliders working well. As of now, we have the slider to change the temperature of fans near working. Both of us also worked on the PRD.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate built a few different Yocto-based Linux distros with some settings pre-baked into the distro such as enabling the CAN and HDMI controllers automatically (previously a manual change), but that was as far as they got as pre-bundling things in the image. They attempted and failed to build nw for the Freescale i.MX6 and decided to ditch that hardware platform. They began to mock-up a general-purpose microcontroller board/circuit to handle our vibration and pre-touch control. Nate also helped with PRD.<br>

                        Mitchell and Vinod will get the overall framework of the applications figured out and complete. We will also interface the UI with CANbus, and test to see if climate control perform well.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate will plan to have an understanding of how to process sound inputs to measure the Doppler effect in an effort to choose a microcontroller architecture (processing power-wise) to move forward with.<br>

As of now, as we constantly read messages through the UW high speed network, we are also able to write messages through GMLAN low speed for climate control. Mitchell worked with the Arduino board and was able to confirm being able to use it with <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">johnny-five</a>, a Javascript Arduino Programming framework.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate were able to get Linux installed on the FreeScale i.MX6. However, as of now it cannot detect the USB and HDMI, and we believe this may be due to the difficulties of getting it to shutdown properly without pulling the plug.<br>
                        <br>
                        <b>For next week:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        We are meeting with Chen on Monday to discuss adding vibration. We also hope to speak with the contact Professor Patel mentioned for pre-touch gesture sensing. The goal is to choose to implement one of these for our entertainment system.<br>
                        <br>
                        Mitch and Vinod will attempt to finish the climate control application. We were told to choose one application for the scope of this project, and we are still unsure which one we would choose. We hope to get most of the climate control application done by next week so that even if we do not choose that as our application for this class, it gives us a good exercise for working with MarrionetteJS.<br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan and Nate will research <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/about">Yocto</a> and see if it is stable enough to fix the current issues. They will also see if the ARM processor will perform well with our applications.<br>
                        <br>
                        So, the next week is basically half of us working on the apps while in parallel, half of us work with the freescale hardware. If we find that the app performs poorly with the i.MX6's ARM processor, we may have to discuss changing our project features so that we use the other minicomputer we have already done some development on, but implement both vibration and gesture sensing.

                        <b>In the past week:</b><br>
                        <br>
                        1. Vinod and Mitchell completed the website. We coded our own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Project Details section contains an overview of our project named EVE. Once we have information for parts of the class like Kickstarter, we will add a section for it to the site. <br>
                        2. Ryan and Nate have been researching how to install Linux on the i.MX6 freescale processor. We were not able to find clear instructions on how to do this, but we did learn about the <a href="https://www.yoctoproject.org/about">Yocto</a> which helps create Linux-based systems for any hardware architecture. <br>
                        3. We all attended lab, and discussed our project with the TA. We discussed the hardware components and how we may be able to talk to someone who has experiance with vibration technology. <br>
                        4. We planned out what each of us will discuss during our presentation tomorrow. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Once we get feedback from our presentation, our goals for the next week are:</b> <br>
                        <br>
                        1. For Mitch and Vinod, set up a <a href="http://marionettejs.com/">Marionette</a> based home app. Marionette is an application library for JavaScript used to assist in the creation of large-scale applications. This means looking at other projects in EcoCar that have used Marionette and expand on them to make sure we have our own architecture for EVE. <br>
                        2. For Ryan and Nate, install Linux on the i.MX6, and research how to create CAN drivers for it. <br>
