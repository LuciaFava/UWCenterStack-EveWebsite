                        The EVE team is working with the UW EcoCAR 2 team. The EcoCAR 2 competition is a 3 year collegiate engineering competition. The competition challenges 15 universities across North America to reduce the environmental impact of a Chevrolet Malibu without compromising performance, safety and consumer acceptability. The competition is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and General Motors (GM). The competition follows the real-world Vehicle Development Process (VDP). <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Year 1</h3>
                        The first year of the competition was focused on design and simulation. Many vehicle architectures were explored before the UW EcoCAR 2 team decided to go with a Parallel Through-The-Road hybrid. On the front axel is a 1.7 L Diesel engine, and on the rear axel is a powerful electric motor powered by a 19.6 kWh battery pack. This design enables the vehicle to drive 30-40 miles without using any fuel, and then after the battery is nearly depleted, the diesel engine and electric motor can work together to optimize efficiency. At the Year 1 Competition, the UW EcoCAR 2 placed 5th out of the 15 teams for their designs and simulations. <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Year 2</h3>
                        In year two of the competition, the Malibu was delivered to the UW EcoCAR 2 lab and the overhaul began. The stock engine was removed and the new engine, motor, and battery were integrated into the car. At the Year 2 Competition, the modified car was tested in areas of performance, energy consumption, and emissions. The UW EcoCAR 2 team placed 4th overall. <br>
					    <br>
                        <h3>Year 3</h3>
                        Currently the UW EcoCAR 2 team is preparing for the Year 3 Competition where the car will be retested. The focus of this year has been refinement. Many of the software bugs and mechanical issues have been resolved. By the time of the competition, the car should feel like it just came off the assembly line. <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>More Information</h3>

                        Freescale Semiconductor has donated an iMX.6 Sabre Automotive Infotainment processor board to each team. Freescale is also is offering a $1,000 cash prize to the team that can use their hardware to create an innovative touch screen interface in the team's car. <br>
                        <br>
                        At the Year 2 Competition, the UW EcoCAR 2 team attempted to use the QNXCAR 2 platform on the iMX.6 hardware to run HTML5 apps that could communicate with other controllers in the vehicle over the vehicle CAN buses. However, there were many issues with the QNXCAR 2 software that were not able to be overcome. Despite these challenges, the UW EcoCAR 2 team was able to demonstrate their unique touch screen interface using several BlackBerry Playbooks. The interface features a clear plastic overlay on the screen with cut outs in it (much like a stencil) to help guide a user's finger without the user having to look at the screen. This concept impressed the judges and the UW EcoCAR 2 team earned 2nd place in the Freescale Innovation Award and earned a $500 prize. <br>
                        <br>
                        This year the EVE team aims to assist the UW EcoCAR 2 team in achieving 1st place!

                       Furthermore, gentle but clear vibrations upon interaction provide worthwhile cues to the user to accomplish their task. Therefore, EVE offers easy steps and measures to enjoy its Apps without sacrificing safety.

                        Freescale Semiconductor has donated an iMX.6 Sabre Automotive Infotainment board. The iMX.6 is an embedded platform with a quad-core 1 GHz processor and all of the peripheral capabilities imaginable for an automotive purpose. It includes 2 CAN bus connections, HDMI, USB, audio in/out, ethernet, bluetooth capabilities and more. The low power consumption, low cost, and small form factor of the iMX.6 make it an ideal platform for running EVE in an automotive environment. <br>
                        <br>
                        The EVE interface has been developed as a node-webkit app. The UI is written in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and thanks to the power of node-webkit, is rendered in a fullscreen webkit browser while simultaneously running node.js to access additional hardware and networking capabilities that take advantage of the iMX.6. Combine EVE, node-webkit, Ubuntu, and the iMX.6 and you have the next generation touchscreen interface.

                    <p>
                        CAN stands for Control Area Network. It is a bus protocol that is used for data communication through messages between the different parts of the car. The main benefit of CAN is that it has greatly decreases the amount of wiring between the numerous electrical components in the vehicle. When it comes to the Chevy Malibu our team is working on, GMLAN is a local area network that uses the CAN protocol to provide two different communication links: low speed and high speed. The low speed bus, utilized mainly for operator control functions, uses a single wire (SWCAN) and operates at a baud rate of 33.333 kbps. Whereas, the high speed bus, which contain meaningful and real-time data, uses two wires and operates at a baud rate of 500kbps. <br>
						<br>
                        When it comes to EVE, CAN is used for many its features. For example with climate control, the user's interaction on the touch screen indicating to turn on the fan triggers a CAN message to be sent through the low-speed bus to accomplish the task. Also, the high-speed bus constantly reads messages containing information that is analyzed and provided to the driver to help them develop safe and efficient driving habits.
